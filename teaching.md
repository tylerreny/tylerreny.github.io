This is a beginners R course for incoming graduate students in political science at UCLA. The purpose of this course is to starting thinking about functional programming and data analysis in a systematic way using the latest in R packages (dplyr, ggplot2, etc) to clean, analyze, and visualize real data. By the end of the course, students should have an understanding of object oriented languages, work flow, reproducibility, data munging, summarizing data, and visualizing data. Each of the four courses should take about 2 hours to complete. 

Before you show up to the first course, please download R and R-Studio ([here](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) is a tutorial if you get stuck) and complete this [Try-R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) short course that will introduce you to the very basics of R. I assume you will have a very basic understanding of R by Day 1 below. If you have any issues with the install process, please reach out to me before the course starts!

**R Resources**

A lot of the R Course material was borrowed and adapted from Kathy Bryant's excellent [UBC Stat 545 course](http://stat545.com/faq.html). She goes much further in depth on all topics than I do. I strongly recommend referring back to this site as needed.

There are a number of very useful [*cheatsheets*](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) produced by the folks over at R-Studio that I refer to often.

I have also recently come across [Software Carpentry's lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), several of which address programming with R. They look pretty good. If you check them out let me know what you think.
