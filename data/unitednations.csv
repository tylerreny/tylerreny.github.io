After hearing refugees’ stories on a visit to Jordan last year, UK
artist Hannah Rose Thomas came up with the innovative idea of
recycling old UNHCR tents as a canvas for refugees to express
themselves.

Around 200 refugees painted three tents on the themes of ‘Hope’,
‘Memories’ and ‘The Impact of War On Families’.

The most common image expressed by the refugees however, one that kept reoccurring, was ‘home’, highlighting the longing of many refugees for the conflict to end and to return to their lives.

The results have been so powerful that the tents are now set to be
exhibited in locations across the world.

Exactly 70 years ago today, since 50 nations came together in San Francisco, USA, and created a new organization for peace, prosperity and human rights. 

On 26 June 1945, in the auditorium of the Veterans' Memorial Hall, the delegates filed up one by one to a huge round table on which the UN Charter lay. Behind each delegate stood the other members of the delegation against a colourful semi-circle of the flags of fifty nations. In the dazzling brilliance of powerful spotlights, each delegate affixed their signature. China, first victim of aggression by an Axis power, had the honour of signing first. 

""The Charter of the United Nations which you have just signed,"" said US President Truman ""is a solid structure upon which we can build a better world. History will honor you for it . . .

This week, we visit the unique ceiling painting by Spanish abstract artist Miquel Barceló at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. 

The sculpture consists of many layers of coloured paints composed of pigments from across the globe, sprayed across the ceiling to create stalactites. The work is groundbreaking both artistically and technically and represents the themes of multiculturalism, mutual tolerance and understanding between cultures.

Today we mark World Humanitarian Day, a day when we honour the people who go the extra mile to help others.

These last few weeks we have witnessed moments of despair and pain, but also incredible kindness, solidarity and generosity in response to refugees arriving in Europe. We’re sharing these stories with you in a Storify called ""Humanity Saving Humanity in Europe.""

These are incredible examples of everyday humanitarian gestures - by ordinary people, with ordinary lives - making an extraordinary difference to those forced to flee wars, persecution and violence.

We know there are many more stories of humanity out there from around the world, and we'd love to hear yours. Please share your stories or links in the comments below so that we can all be inspired on this important day.

The idea of the UN issuing its own stamps was first proposed by Argentina in 1947. An agreement with the United States postal authorities was reached in 1951 and the first UN stamps were issued in U.S. dollar denominations on United Nations Day, 24 October. The stamps were an immediate success and sold out within days. 

The image on the first 1¢ stamp, shown here, was titled ”Peoples of the World”. Designed by O.C. Meronti, Chief Designer of Thomas de la Rue and Company, Ltd., London, the horizontal vignette shows a group of five figures representing humankind liberated from chains of bondage and looking toward the United Nations Emblem rising over a peaceful and prosperous landscape. 

The text “United Nations” appears in the border of the stamp in what were then the five official languages as the border of the stamp.

In the centre is a small opening where natural light enters the room. The wooden battens are mahogany covered with a copper alloy.

The abstract paintings on either side were originally designed by Fernand Léger, the late French painter, and painted by one of his pupils.

Walid, a Syrian refugee in Hungary, helped organize some 1,000 refugees march out of Budapest towards the Austrian border. The group had walked 25 km when they stopped to rest. Hours later at 2am, Hungarian buses arrived to take them the rest of the way to Austria.

When the refugees spilled out of dozens of buses on the Austrian side of the border, they looked dazed, exhausted but guardedly happy. They were met by volunteers from the Austrian Red Cross and the Austrian Order of Malta holding handwritten signs saying 'welcome', and handing out clothes, food, water and milk, blankets and rain gear.


Europe is at a defining moment and must prepare to receive as many as 200,000 new refugees. This is a huge step forward but much more needs to be done.

The tabs of the sheet feature Pope Francis and the background image features the world surrounded by laurel leaves in open hands symbolizing the healing and togetherness of the planet. 

In his address to world leaders in the UN General Assembly, the Pope said that without the efforts of the United Nations “mankind would not have been able to survive the unchecked use of its own possibilities.”

He also discussed the ""right of the environment"" saying that any harm done to the environment is harm done to humanity.”

During the 6th session of the General Assembly, held in Paris in 1951, Japan's Observer to the UN, Chiyoji Nakagawa, proposed building a hallmark of hope to see “the end of wars.” 

He began casting the Peace Bell from coins and medals donated by Member States, the Pope and others – including children from more than 60 nations.

In 1954, the UN Association of Japan donated the Peace Bell to the UN. Japan was not yet a Member State at this time.

A stateless child is born somewhere in the world at least every 10 minutes, meaning this is a growing problem. In countries hosting the 20 largest stateless populations, at least 70,000 stateless children are born each year.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says children and youth have a sense of identification with the countries in which they were born and have lived all their lives. In almost all cases the best solution to statelessness is to turn a child’s existing links with his or her country of birth and upbringing into the legal bond of nationality. It is vital that this is achieved as early as possible so that no child grows up with the indignities and harm caused by statelessness.

More than 240,000 students will receive school meals this academic year as WFP expands its school meals programme from 735 to 1,605 primary schools across the country.

Due to the Ebola outbreak, public schools in Guinea remained closed after the 2014 summer holidays to help limit the spread of the virus. In January 2015, as schools began to reopen, WFP played an important role in encouraging families to send their children to school by gradually scaling-up the number of school canteens.

Providing school meals is crucial in a country where 1.9 million people do not have enough food to lead healthy lives. The country is also still bearing the brunt of the Ebola outbreak, and people remain vulnerable."

Dorcas has been living in the Saint Sauveur site in the Central African Republic (CAR) with her parents for almost two years now. In March, she and her family were able to briefly return home to Bangui, the capital. But just a few months later, they were forced to return to the camp following an upsurge of violence.

Today, close to a million people – one in five Central Africans - are displaced. Instead of toys, the children of CAR are demanding peace. Peace is the only thing that will make it safe enough to go home."
