The attached replication file includes an R script that will reproduce all the figures and tables in the article: `replication_file_CPS_nostalgic_deprivation.R` and the variables from the two datasets used in the study in two csv files: `replication_data_us.csv` and `replication_data_uk.csv`. The `cps_survey_instrument_us.doc` has the questions for the surveys (US version, the only difference are the questions about support for the radical right). If you have any questions please contact Tyler Reny at ttreny@gmail.com.
