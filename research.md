**``The Negative Effects of Mass Media Stereotypes of Latinos and Immigrants" In *Media and Minorities: Questions on Representation from an International Perspective*. Eds Georg Ruhrmann, Yasemin Shooman, and Peter Widmann. Jewish Museum of Berlin Press**

In this chapter, we leverage data from  a national survey and an interactive
online experiment to answer two key questions. First, which stereotypes
about Latinos and immigrants do Americans hold? Second, does exposure to
these stereotypes from popular media sources reinforce or attenuate them?
We find convincing evidence that non-Latinos attribute both negative and
positive stereotypes to Latinos and immigrants, that these stereotypes are
not moderated by interpersonal contact with Latinos or immigrants, and that
news and entertainment media can shape public opinion about Latinos and
immigrants in a variety of ways [[PDF]](http://tylerreny.github.io/pdf/pubs/reny_manzano_stereotypes_2016.pdf)

**Immigrant Political Ambition:  New Americans and the Quest for Political Office** (with Paru Shah) forthcoming at *Social Sciences Quarterly*

Objective: Record numbers of first- and second-generation immigrants have won elected office over the last few electoral cycles, yet we find immigrants are still underrepresented at all levels of government. What are the perceived barriers to entry into political life among these New Americans? 
Method: Using a unique survey dataset that includes an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants who have enrolled in civic leadership trainings, we examine the similarities and differences between immigrant and non-immigrant leaders. 
Results: We find that immigrants are in many ways similar to their non-immigrant counterparts in that access to structural resources help shape their political ambition. Yet immigrants, unlike their non-immigrant counterparts, often have less of these resources and perceive their ability to capitalize on these resources as less feasible. 
Conclusions: We find that the traditional barriers to office---lack of professional and political experiences, finances, and monied networks---all contribute to lower self-perceived qualifications for office among both immigrants and non-immigrants. Yet the New American leaders who are highly politically involved, deeply rooted in their communities, and well-positioned to run for office, face the additional psychological barriers posed by their race and ethnicity, immigrant identity, citizenship status, language ability, and acculturation, barriers that are often offered in open-ended essays as self-evident and crippling. Leadership training programs play a crucial role in providing training and instilling confidence in would-be immigrant candidates.

**El peso del voto Latino en 2016** (with Sergio I. Garcia-Rios, Angela X. Ocampo, and Bryan Wilcox-Archuleta) *Foreign Affairs Latinoamerica* Volumen 17, Numero 1. 

In this article we use precinct level election and demographic data to estimate Latino 2016 presidential general election votes in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas. We find that Trump won an estimated 16% of the Latino vote, a historic low and well below Exit Poll estimates. [[PDF]](http://revistafal.com/fal-17-1/)

**Demographic Change, Latino Countermobilization, and the Politics of Immigration in U.S. Senate Campaigns** *Revise and resubmit*

Demographic changes from decades of mass immigration and shifts in internal migration patterns are upending the traditional racial composition of many states throughout the United States, transforming the American electorate, and increasing both the political salience of immigration and the racial salience of Latinos. Politicizing these visible demographic shifts has become an increasingly common strategy by both Democrats and Republicans with potentially significant electoral effects. While many have examined the impact of these demographic changes on dominant receiving populations' attitudes, few have examined how changing demographics are shaping immigration politics in electoral campaigns. Specifically, under what conditions do political candidates politicize demographic change? I hypothesize that both political and demographic considerations drive variation in immigration appeals. I test my hypotheses using candidate campaign websites from 2010, 2012, and 2014 U.S. Senate primary and general elections. I argue that racial party cleavages increase the electoral temptation of immigration appeals but it is the interaction between Latino population growth, electoral competition, and Latino voters that determines campaign strategy more broadly and moderates the use of pro- and anti-immigrant appeals [[working paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggcdkmq4d5vx6d5/field_paper_1.pdf?dl=0) [[working code]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ir9ui50mzbxqua8/senate_immigration_reproduction.R?dl=0) 

**Roots of the Radical Right: Perceived Deprivation in the US and Britain (with Justin Gest and Jeremy Mayer)** *Revise and resubmit*

Following trends in Europe over the past decade, support for the Radical Right has recently grown more significant in the United States and the United Kingdom. While the United Kingdom has witnessed the rise of Radical Right fringe groups, the United States political spectrum has been altered by the Tea Party and the candidacy of Donald Trump. This paper asks what predicts individuals’ support for such groups and for anti-system political behavior more generally. In original representative surveys of whites in England and the United States, we use an innovative technique to measure subjective social, political, and economic status that captures individuals' perceptions of increasing or decreasing deprivation over time. We then analyze the impact of these deprivation measures on support for the Radical Right among Republicans (Conservatives), Democrats (Labourites), and Independents. We show that perceived deprivation drives support for the far right in England and the United States. 

**Public Reactions to Anti-Latino Appeals in the Age of Obama: Race, Illegality and Changing Norms* (with Loren Collingwood and Ali Valenzuela)**

While the use and effects of anti-Black appeals in American electoral campaigns have been well-documented, recent increases in the salience of immigration and immigrants, particularly from Latin America, have raised new questions about the use of anti-immigrant appeals in U.S. politics. Anti-immigrant appeals, we argue, represent a new form of racial appeals that combine non-racial language with racialized images of Latinos in order to garner electoral support among racially conservative Americans. In this project we address two related questions about this phenomenon. First, are anti-Latino appeals as effective as anti-Black appeals in generating support for the sponsoring candidates? Second, are implicit anti-Latino appeals more effective at generating support than explicit anti-Latino appeals in the same way as implicit anti-Black appeals have been shown to be more effective than explicit anti-Black appeals because the latter violate norms of racial equality? We posit that heightened attention to anti-Black rhetoric in the age of Obama has increased the likelihood that even implicit anti-Black appeals will be perceived as racist, decreasing their effectiveness. Anti-Latino appeals, however, may not yet be perceived as violating norms of equality in the minds of most Americans. Implicit anti-Latino appeals, therefore, should prime racial attitudes, trigger emotions like anger and fear, and increase support for the sponsoring candidate. Making anti-Latino appeals explicit, however, should trigger norms of equality and neutralize support for the candidate. We test our theory using an online survey experiment where we exposed respondents to anti-Latino and anti-Black political advertisements from a fictitious Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. To half of the subjects exposed to the advertisements, we delivered a second treatment that highlights the racial content of the advertisement they saw in order to assess whether making respondents aware of this racial content neutralizes their persuasive appeal. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that our anti-Black appeals are relatively ineffective, but that implicit Latino appeals are effective in garnering support for the candidate among those with higher levels of racial resentment [[working paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/520u2aps4yy6xwp/apsa_2016_reny_valenzuela_collingwood.pdf?dl=0)
