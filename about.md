Tyler grew up in Round Pond, Maine, with dreams of becoming a boat builder, jazz musician, and chef. He studied government, Spanish, and Latin American studies at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. He later interned for Senator Olympia Snowe in Washington D.C. and his first job landed him in New York City where I helped train first- and second-generation immigrants to run for public office at [New American Leaders](http://www.newamericanleaders.org/). He now study American politics, campaigns and elections, racial and ethnic politics, and political methodology at UCLA. He is particularly interested in understanding the origins and political consequences of racial attitudes in the United States.
