*Damariscotta Lake, Nobleboro, Maine*

I grew up in Round Pond, Maine, with dreams of becoming a boat builder, jazz musician, and chef. I studied government and Latin American studies at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. I later interned for Senator Olympia Snowe in Washington D.C. and my first job landed me in New York City where I helped train first- and second-generation immigrants to run for public office at [The New American Leaders Project](http://www.newamericanleaders.org/). I now study American government, campaigns and elections, racial and ethnic politics, and political methodology at UCLA. I'm particularly interested in the political effects of demographic change and contemporary racial appeals as well as political ambition and candidate development. I'm also passionate about good coffee.
