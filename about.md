*Damariscotta Lake, Nobleboro, Maine*

I grew up in Round Pond, Maine, with dreams of becoming a boat builder, jazz musician, and chef. I studied government and Latin American studies at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. I later interned for Senator Olympia Snowe in Washington D.C. and my first job landed me in New York City where I helped train first- and second-generation immigrants to run for public office at [The New American Leaders Project](http://www.newamericanleaders.org/). I now study American government, campaigns and elections, racial and ethnic politics, and political methodology at UCLA. I am particularly interested in the political effects of demographic change and contemporary racial appeals as well as political ambition and candidate development. I'm also passionate about good coffee.
