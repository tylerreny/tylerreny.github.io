Tyler grew up in Midcoast Maine, with dreams of becoming a boat builder, jazz musician, and chef. He studied political science, Spanish, and Latin American studies at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. He later interned in the U.S. Senate and landed his first job in New York City where he helped train first- and second-generation immigrants to run for public office at [New American Leaders](http://www.newamericanleaders.org/). He now studies identity politics.
